Find plugins and themes like The Flash. Filter and sort based on installations, ratings, and many other criteria.

== Description ==

Addendio provides an alternative search for plugins and themes. Just type your keywords and Addendio will search through the title, description and tags. See the results updating in front of you immediately (make sure you don't blink). Don't like the results? You can filter based on number of installations, ratings, etc.
Still don't like what you see? You can simply sort the result according to your criteria.

You can filter on the following criteria: Installs, Downloads, Rating, Number of ratings, Last update. Plugin type.

**Keyword Search**
Addendio searches instantly based on Title, Description, Tags and Author.

**Installs**
This shows you how popular a plugin is. Popularity doesn't always means the best in town, but it provides an indication of the install base for the plugin you are looking at.

**Rating**
This is based on the rating given to the plugin/theme. Sometimes the number of ratings is so small that the rating is not particularly meaningful. That's why we have the next criteria, i.e. the number of ratings

**Number of ratings**
You can see how many people voted for the plugin/theme. This helps you decide whether the rating is meaningful or not. For example a 5-star theme based on 3 votes is clearly not a sufficient indicator.

**Last update**
A major issue for some plugins is the latest update date. On June 2015 we counted 17,000 plugins that hadn't been updated for more than 2 years. Chances are that those plugins have been abandoned by the developer. It's not an exact science, but it's worth having this notion in mind when choosing a plugin or a theme.

**Plugin Type (aka Premium vs Standard)**
One important question when searching for a plugin/theme is the following: who's behind this plugin? is it a developer who built this as a hobby or is there a company behind it? This question might seem irrelevant for some cases, but if you want to get an indication of whether the plugin/theme will be supported in the future it's a crucial one. There's no such a thing as a standard definition of what a premium plugin/theme is, so we decided to make our own. 
This is in a nutshell what classifies a plugin/theme as Premium:

1. There's a company behind the plugin/theme
1. Paid/pro version available.
1. This is also valid for plugins that are free, but have an an add-ons strategy (e.g. Easy Digital Downloads, Ninja Forms, etc).
1. Last update date < 2 years

We are still busy categorizing all plugins and themes, so don't be surprised if the coverage is not complete. If you are a theme/plugin author, feel free to get in touch with us and let us know about your product here  [Addendio Contact](https://addendio.com/contact/ "Submit your plugin / theme")

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin
2. Go to Plugins > Search Plugins or Appearance > Search Themes
3. Type some keywords in the search bar and make sure you don't blink if you want to see the results update...
4. Use the left bar to fine tune your search criteria or the top right dropdown menu to sort things as you prefer
5. For any questions feel free to contact us on our support at addendio dot com email address


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you build this? WordPress already has a search functionality for plugins and themes =

True, but we decided there was room for improvement. We created this plugin as we wanted to make it easier for WordPress admins to find plugins and themes. We especially wanted to have more flexibility by allowing to filter and sort on key criteria. This allows you to select and refine with precision only what you are looking for. It becomes easier to compare several plugins as you can rank them according to your preferences.

You can filter on the following criteria: Installs, Downloads, Rating, Number of ratings, Last update. Plugin type.
